Welcome to MigraCode and to the world of Web Development!!!

## Operating Systems

An Operating System (OS) is a powerful, and usually large, program that controls and manages the hardware and software on a computer. All computers and computer-like devices require operating systems, including laptops, tablets, desktops, and smartphones. The OS performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

The most common operating systems for desktop and laptop computers are:
- Microsoft Windows (Windows 95, Windows 7, Windows 10,...)
- Linux (Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,..)
- macOS
- Chrome OS
- Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.

### Unix

Unix is ​​a family of operating systems. The first version was developed starting in 1969. Unix is ​​characterized by being portable and multitasking.

Unix operating systems are widely used in a multitude of devices that range from the most capable supercomputers to the mobile phones and computers that we use daily. The philosophy of Unix systems is characterized by:

- a hierarchical file system,
- a large collection of small programs that can work in series,
- the use of text files to store the data,
- treating devices as files.

Linux and MacOS are examples of Unix systems.

### Linux

Linux is a family of Unix-like operating systems that use the Linux kernel.
The name comes from the original programmer, a student named Linus Torvals, who in 1991, working with the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation, created the first version of this operating system.

Linux development is one of the clearest examples of free, open source software development by a diverse community of programmers all over the world. Anyone can use the operating system, study it and modify it. The open source nature of Linux is protected by the GPL (GNU General Public License).

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution. It is an open-source operating system aimed at desktop users, and its strengths are that it is easy to use and install. Although the desktop is somewhat different from Windows or Mac OS, a user who is accustomed to any of these operating systems will not have many problems becoming familiar with Ubuntu.
Ubuntu is based on a maintained distribution by a community called Debian. Debian's main goal is to create a robust operating system that includes the largest possible proportion of free programs.

If you are using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), you will see this sreen:

</div>

Demo of Ubuntu:
- The friendly Desktop
- The filesystem: navigate through folders and files using File Manager
- Ubuntu software: a tool to install software easily

## The Command Line

The **Command Line**, also knows as **Bash**, **Terminal** or **Shell** (**Línea de Comandos** ó **Símbolo de sistema** in Spanish) is a way of controlling a computer, based on a text interface. 

![Ubuntu Bash](assets/lesson-0/ubuntu-bash.png)

Why should I use the command line/terminal?

* Once you know the basics, it helps you to interact with you computer faster
* Some software for developers must always be used from a terminal
* You have more control over the software
* It allows you to create scripts (lists of commands) and automate manual tasks
* It is what hackers use in movies.

### How do I use the terminal on my computer?

Here are the instructions for the three operating system: 

- MacOS: You can find the Terminal.app in your Applications, in the folder Utilities. An alternative way to open the Terminal is to search with Spotlight and type in “terminal”. Select the application called terminal and press the return key. This should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using the command line.
- Linux: You can open the Terminal by directly pressing [ctrl+alt+T] or you can search for it by clicking the dash (#) icon, typing in “terminal” in the search box, and opening the Terminal application. This should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using the command line.
- Windows: Windows has its own **Command Prompt**. It is very similar to the Unix command line, but some commands are not exactly the same. For the main differences go to this [link](https://enexdi.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/windows_vs_mac_commands_1.pdf). Because of these differences, and because we want to learn UNIX commands, we use the **Git Bash**. Go to the Windows "Start" button and search the program **Git Bash**. When you open it you will see a screen like this one:

![Windows Git Bash](assets/lesson-0/gitbash.PNG)

After you have followed the instructions, open a terminal and write `ls`, then press the `Enter` key. What do you see?

### Commonly used commands

There's a set of commands you will become comfortable with during the course. These commands allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.

* `cd` - change directory. To move up one folder level and into the parent directory use: `cd ..`
* `ls` - list the contents of a directory. Can also be used as `ls [directory_name]` to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with `cd`) to it
* `pwd` - print working directory: print the full location of the folder you are working in
* `mkdir [name]` - make directory: create a new directory, with the given `name` after a space
* `touch [file_name]` - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like `.css` or `.html`)
* `rm [file_name]` - remove a file
* `rm -r [directory_name]` - remove a directory (**and all files inside that directory**)


#### Command Syntax and using flags

Commands can be run by themselves or you can pass in additional arguments to make them do different things. For this, you us flags. Flags are a way to set options and the commands you run will change their behavior based on what flags are set. You should read the documentation of each command to know what flags are available.
Think of flags as accessories. You have your basic command like rm (remove) that deletes a file. If you add -r (stands for recursive), the command rm -r deletes a folder plus all subfolders and files inside them. If you add -f (stands for force), the command rm -f removes everything you ask. 

**Syntax** `command [-argument] [-argument] [--argument] (filename)`  

Example | Flags
--------|-------
`ls` | List all files in current directory
`ls -l` | List files in long format
`ls -l --color` | As above, with colorized output
`cat filename` | Show contents of a file
`cat -n filename` | Show contents of a file, with line numbers


#### Getting Help

When you're stuck and need help with a Linux command, help is usually only a few keystrokes away! Help on most Linux commands is typically built right into the commands themselves, available through online help programs (“man pages” and “info pages”), and of course online.

![Help](assets/lesson-0/help.PNG)

### More commands

#### Commands for Navigating the filesystem

The first thing you usually want to do when learning about the Linux filesystem is take some time to look around and see what's there! These next few commands will: 
- a) Tell you where you are, 
- b) take you somewhere else, and 
- c) show you what's there. The following table describes the basic operation of the pwd, cd, and ls commands, and compares them to certain DOS commands that you might already be familiar with.

![Commands1](assets/lesson-0/commands1.PNG)

![Commands2](assets/lesson-0/commands2.PNG)

#### Working With Files and Directories

These commands can be used to: find out information about files, display files, and manipulate them in other ways (copy, move, delete).

![Commands3](assets/lesson-0/commands3.PNG)

#### Finding things

The following commands are used to find files. “ls” is good for finding files if you already know approximately where they are, but sometimes you need more powerful tools such as these:

![Commands4](assets/lesson-0/commands4.PNG)

#### Other Utilities

Here are some other commands that are useful to know:

![Commands5](assets/lesson-0/commands5.PNG)

Some tips to be a master using commands:

- Autocomplete: when you are writing the name of an existing command or folder, press TAB to automplete
- History: press up-arrow to see the last commands you executed, so you don't have to write again the most used commands

### Exercises

**Exercise T-1:** Open a terminal and create the following structure:

* terminal-exercises-1
  * src
    * css
    * html

To check out we can run ls with R option (ls -R) from folder /terminal-exercises-1   

**Exercise T-2:** add files to the css and html folders, the final structure should be like:

* terminal-exercises-1
  * src
    * css
      * file1.css
    * html
      * file2.html

**Exercise T-3:** go to the folder /terminal-exercises-1, create a file with the name index.html, once created move it to the folder /html
The final structure should be like:

* terminal-exercises-1
  * src
    * css
      * file1.css
    * html
      * file2.html
      * index.html

## Development Tools

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code or VS Code is an IDE, 
IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment". It is the software that you
will be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop
your apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of
having to search Google for minor details.

#### Auto-complete

One of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides
"auto-completion". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can
can write next, while you are typing something.

For example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can
assign it to.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/ide-auto-complete.png"
    width="300"
    alt="IDE - Auto complete"
  />
</div>

#### File tree view

The reason why we call it "Integrated" is that you almost don't need to leave
the window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files
can be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from
something called a "Tree view", which you can usually find on the left side of
your IDE.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/file-tree.png"
    width="200"
    alt="IDE - File tree"
  />
</div>

#### Finding files

When working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,
without having to go through the tree view manually.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/find-file.gif"
    width="500"
    alt="IDE - Find file"
  />
</div>

#### Enable formatting on save

* In Visual Studio open the settings file (see [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings))
* Search for `editor format`
* Set `editor.formatOnSave` and `editor.formatOnPaste` to true

#### Open your VS project in a Browser with one click

### Git

We will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).
It's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!

> **What is "version control"?** Version control is a system that records
> changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
> versions later.

> It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire
> project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last
> modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue
> and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things
> up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for
> very little overhead.

> Extract from
> [Git Pro book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

This [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1408464) on StackOverflow by
[si618](http://stackoverflow.com/users/44540/si618) explains very well why we
use Version Control.

So what is **Git**? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,
and by far
[the most popular](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2015#tech-sourcecontrol).

What is **Github**? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and
share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/githubdiagram.png"
    width="300"
    alt="Github"
  />
</div>


#### Get Started

If Git is not installed, follow this tutorial from Github to [setup Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#setting-up-git)

Once is installed set your username and email adress in Git

```sh
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

#### A typical workflow

* If you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically
  to **fork** their repo. Read this guide for instructions
  (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

* If you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps
  https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/


#### Github

During our course, we will be using [Github](https://github.com) to store our
code. Github is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large
companies, like Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.

[MigraCode's Github page >](https://github.com/migracode-barcelona)


#### Using Git through the Terminal

* `git init` **_if it is a new project_**, i.e. a project not **cloned** from a
  repo (or a fork of a repo)
* `git add .` to add local files to the **index**
* `git commit -m "Good explanation of your file changes"` to commit files to the
  local repo
* `git remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl` **_if it is a new project_** (to
  setup the remote url)
* `git remote -v` to verify that the remote url is set correctly
* `git push -u origin master` to push your commits to the remote url (Github in
  our case)

You will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install
Git `git config --global user.name <name>` and `git config --global user.email
<email>`.

Ok ok, let's draw this...

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/gitdraw.png"
    width="500"
    alt="Github"
  />
</div>

The commands `git add .` and `git commit -m "change explanation"` are used to index and save the files in our computer repository, and we will use `git push` to send the changes to Github

## Your first Migracode Github project

Now that you have built a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to
learn about the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools
will be used during the course, so it is important that you become familiarised
with them.

In order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task:
move your CodePen website to a web address under
`https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name`.

In the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website,
in a location where other developers can make changes to it and view a history
of all the updates that you have made.

If you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting
below, please read the rest of this document.

And remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any
point, please ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the
lesson, and will explain them in more detail.

### How to move your code to Github

1. Export your website as a zip from CodePen.
   [Help >](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note
   of the location of this folder.
3. Put the contents of the zip folder in a Github repository.
4. You should now have a page with your code under
   `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`. This is a view of
   your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an
   `index.html`.

### How to publish your website in Github.io

1. Now all that remains is to publish your website! Still under
   `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`, find the settings
   icon in the top right corner.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/repo-settings.png"
    width="200"
    alt="Repo settings"
  />
</div>

2. Find the section named "Github Pages" and select "master branch" in source,
    then hit "Save".

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/repo-settings-pages.png"
    width="200"
    alt="Repo settings - Github pages"
  />
</div>

3. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages
    section. You should see a green bar saying "Your site is published at
    `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`". Click the link,
    verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!


## Homework

* If you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.
  Please use the information in this section to complete it.
* When your website is live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name`,
  please send a link to the slack channel of your class.
* Learn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).
* Open your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update
  CSS. Commit your changes to Github and verify that
  `https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name` has been updated!
* Add, commit and push your changes to Github and check that the changes are applied in the published version

It's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right! When
it happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.
