# General information

## Module Structure

Each module has 3 weeks lessons, and each lesson is divided as follows:
  - **Weekday (4h)**: explain topics through materials syllabus and presentations and coding, in every topic there are one or more exercises that you would give time to the students to do it, later you can show how to solve it
  - **Homework (20h)**: exercises students should complete between the Weekday and the Weekend to practice the new content. As a instructor you don't have to do anything, the Migracode's Education Team will help and push the students to have all exercises finished before the Weekend.
  - **Weekend (4h)**: is a day to practice, at the beginning we would do a recap and check together the homework, after it and with support, they have to do the exercises by their own. The instructor can stop the class to explain a common doubt or solve exercises together. But it is important to let them think and cope the exercises, to not always just copy what the mentor is writing.

## Exercises Repositories in Github

All the exercises students should complete during the class, as homework and on saturday, are all inside a GitHub repository that they fork and clone every module. The structure is as follows:

![Exercises repo folders](./assets/mentors/gitreposfolders.png)

- For each week of the module we have a folder with the week number week-1
- Inside each week folder, we can find 3 folders:
    - InClass: exercises they should complete during the class
    - Homework: exercises they should complete after the class and before Saturday
    - Extra: optional exercises students can complete when they want
- See a [repository example](https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/exercises-js1)

## Tools that we use

As a mentor you can use the O.S. that you have, or you can use other tools not listed taking into account to not confuse students

- Ubuntu: most students have Ubuntu, but there are some students with Mac or Windows
- Visual Code: is the IDE we use for all the languages during the course
- Git: all the students have a GitHub account and push their exercises always using the Terminal
- Node: is the tool we use to execute by command line scripts without UI
- NPM: to install modules and to execute Web Servers
- Chrome: Browser we normally use, and we teach how to use the inspector
- PostreSQL
- DBeaver: as an SQL client with UI
