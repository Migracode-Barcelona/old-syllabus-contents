# Homework

### Readings and games:

Advanced CSS Selectors:

- Read this about [CSS Selectors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/)
- Play this [game](https://flukeout.github.io/) and complete it:

HTML Reading:

- Read this page on [HTML syntax](https://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html)

### Delivery:

[Bikes-for-refugees](https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/html-css-git-exercises) week1/1-bikes-for-refugees

- The aim of the exercise is for your webpage to look like [this](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-london/html-css/assets/screenshot-complete.png) 
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and compare it to the image of the final result. What's different?
- Use semantic markup: Where necessary, replace the `<div>`s with semantic HTML tags. This will not render differently in the browser, but it's good practice to use semantic markup when you can!
- Fix the broken images: Some of the links to images are broken. The images you need are in the `images` folder - please replace any broken image links with the correct paths.
- Style buttons: There are 3 buttons on the page. They need to be styled correctly - remember, re-use styles as much as possible by using classes.
- Fix the positioning: Use Flexbox to move elements around so they are positioned correctly
- Push the changes to your repository in Github

# Workshop (Saturday)

- Check together the result of Bikes-for-refugees project

[Personal Website](https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/html-css-git-exercises) week1/2-website
Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission).

It should include the following elements:

- The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
- A page header with a title and description for the site.
- An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
- A page footer containing info about you or the site.
- Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
- Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
- Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
- Use the sketch below to guide you towards the layout and content you are trying to achieve. _Please note that this is just a sketch - you can choose the colours, fonts and images that you want to use in the page._
