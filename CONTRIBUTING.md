# Contributing

Before starting, please read the following general guidelines and
[Checklist for a lesson](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/syllabus/issues/9).
Participate in the discussion if you'd like.

There are [discussions](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/syllabus/issues)
about each module and every class in a module, make sure to go through them (or
add a new issue/discussion point).

To contribute to the Code Your Future syllabus, fork and open a pull request to
[this repository](https://github.com/Migracode-Barcelona/syllabus-contents).

Contributions are strictly through approved Pull Requests, even for
administrators of the repo.

Since this repository is the blueprint of our syllabus we allow different
cohorts to adapt to their classes' needs, and also update their syllabus
versions to reflect how the class goes.

We should always make sure **master** is relevant and up to date for future
classes with the feedback from the on-going teaching in each CYF chapter.

### Legacy versions

Mentors should point the students to the individual classes on Github (not the
gitbook links) to allow them to get familiar with Git and Github, and to focus
on the individual class. Also Point them to the version on your branch.

* [London](https://code-your-future.github.io/syllabus-london/)
* [Scotland](https://code-your-future.github.io/syllabus-scotland/)

## Publish the Gitbook

A Gitbook for each branch is published automatically on each push:

* [Master Syllabus](https://code-your-future.github.io/syllabus-master/)

For your convenience, you can run Gitbook locally

Install the [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) CLI:

```bash
npm install -g gitbook-cli
```

Install gitbook plugins for this project, if not already installed:

```bash
gitbook install
```

Run the gitbook server which will autoupdate as you change the contents

```
gitbook serve
open http://localhost:4000
```

## Add new modules or lessons

The repo is stuctured as `module-name\week-number` - add your content in the
correct file.

If you've added a new file, then Add it as new entry in
[SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/syllabus/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

If the module contains many individual markdown files, add them as nested
bullets under the main README.

## A Lesson template

Please check the [lesson template](lesson-template.md) and use it as a starting
point for your new lessons.

Each lesson should follow that format - starting with **what we will learn
today** then **class contents**, **homework** and **preparation for next
class**.

The class contents and homework should follow these general guidelines -
[Checklist for a lesson](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/syllabus/issues/9)

Some of the most important guidelines are:

* Focus on exercises in the class rather than presentations or long explanations
* Prefer pointers to good documentation over explaining everything in the lesson
  itself
* The homework should be relevant, get harder gradually with an (optional)
  stretch goal for more advanced students.
